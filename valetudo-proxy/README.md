# Home Assistant Add-on: Valetudo Proxy

⚠️ This addon does not contain Valetudo ⚠️

This addon acts as a proxy to an already running Valetudo instance.
The sole purpose of this addon is to add a Valetudo icon to the sidebar of Home Assistant which will open the frontend of Valetudo on your robot vacuum.

## Options

- `server` (required): this should be the local URL of your robot vacuum , e.g. `http://192.168.2.43`. Make sure there is no trailing slash!
